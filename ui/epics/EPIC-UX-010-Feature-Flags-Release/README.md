# EPIC-UX-010 — Feature Flags & Controlled Rollout

Goal: Allow iterative release of UX features with feature flags and controlled rollout.

Milestones:
- Add feature flag framework (lightweight client-side & server-check overrides)
- Enable per-PR ephemeral flags for testers
- Allow gradual percentage rollouts and quick rollback

Acceptance criteria:
- Feature toggles configurable and respected in UI
- Simple admin UI for toggling features (or config file) for staging
