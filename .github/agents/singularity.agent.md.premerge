# Note
This file points to the `singularity/` folder as the canonical repo root. The authoritative agent file lives at `singularity/.github/agents/singularity.agent.md` (repoRoot: `.`) and contains the full instructions. Keep this root-level file minimal and in sync if you change the canonical location.
